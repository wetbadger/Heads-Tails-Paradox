These games are meant to show unintuitive concepts in probability.

Game 1:

You go to a casino and play a brand new game where they flip two hidden coins, and then you place a bet. Then they tell you honestly, "one of the coins came up heads, do you want to bet the other coin is heads or tails?" Except if both coins had come up tails, they don't say anything, your bet is simply refunded. It turns out that, after playing many games, you would lose money betting heads, and you would win money by betting tails. 

Game 2:

This casino also offers a similar game where the only difference is that they flip the coins one at a time. You bet on the outcome of the yet-to-be-flipped coin after one coin has already landed on heads or tails. Just like in the first game, if the coins come up tails-tails, the casino will issue a refund. What has changed? Now it makes the most sense to always bet heads!

Both games are exactly the same on the surface. The only win or lose conditions are HH, TH, and HT. 

The two games both rule out the double-tails outcome, yet the best bet flips depending on when you learn one coin is heads. If you only hear ‘at least one head’ after both coins are tossed, tails is the winner. If you see the first coin before the second is tossed, heads takes the edge.

In game 1:

If you bet tails, TT refunds, HT wins, TH wins, and HH loses. So you win ⅔.

If you bet heads, TT refunds, HT loses, TH loses, and HH wins. So you win ⅓.

The expected value for betting tails is a positive number. For tails: EV = (−1 + 1 + 1 + 0)/4 = +1/4 = +0.25 per trial.

For heads: EV = (1 − 1 − 1 + 0)/4 = −1/4 = −0.25 per trial.

In game 2:

If you bet tails, TT refunds, HT wins, and TH or HH loses. So you win ⅓.

If you bet heads, TT refunds, HT loses, TH wins, and HH wins, so you win ⅔.

For tails: EV = (−1 + 1 − 1 + 0)/4 = −1/4 = −0.25 per trial.

For heads: EV = (1 − 1 + 1 + 0)/4 = +1/4 = +0.25 per trial.
